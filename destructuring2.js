/* 
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name 
when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new 
name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
// userName = 'John Doe', userAge = 34
You may read it as "get the value of user.name 
and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent 
destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables 
highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow 
from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.
